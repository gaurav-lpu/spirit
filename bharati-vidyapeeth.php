				</div>

					<p>During the last 56 years Bharati Vidyapeeth has made astonishing strides in the field of education, particularly, higher and professional education. Today Bharati Vidyapeeth conducts more than 156 educational units of various kindsâ€™ right from pre-primary schools to postgraduate institutions and full-ledged professional university (BVDU)</p>
					<p>Today, Bharati Vidyapeeth has its major campuses in New Delhi, Navi Mumbai, Pune, Solapur, Kolhapur, Sangli, Karad, Satara, and Panchgani and at quite a few other places. Bharati Vidyapeeth is probably the only organization from Maharashtra having its campus in the capital city of India. It is not in the urban areas alone that Bharati Vidyapeeth has started its institutions. Its schools and colleges have dotted rural areas and even the remotest tribal and coastal areas of Maharashtra.</p>
					<p>Bharati Vidyapeeth runs more than 78 schools and 60 institutions of higher education, including those of professional education. Among these are colleges of Medicine, Dentistry, Ayurved, Homeopathy, Nursing, Pharmacy, Law, Biotechnology, Engineering, Management, Hotel Management & Catering Technology, Environment Science, Agriculture, Physical education and more.

					<p>Dr. Patangrao Kadam subsequently expanded the scope of his activities and started many other institutions as its sister concerns. They include cooperative units of various kinds, several trusts, quite a few service institutions and even an orphanage.</p>
					<p>The corporate office of Bharati Vidyapeeth is located in the prestigious area of Deccan Gymkhana in the city of Pune.

He has always emphasized that the students of Bharati Vidyapeeth should get updated and excellent education in a very hospitable and conducive atmosphere. So Bharati Vidyapeeth is very selective about the appointment of its academic staff. It provides enriched infrastructural facilities, well-equipped libraries and laboratories, well-developed and sprawling playgrounds and other amenities in its institutions. There is hardly any school or college of Bharati Vidyapeeth, which does not have its own building.</p>
